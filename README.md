# BreastNet
A neural network-based approach to classify breast cancer.






🌸 Breast Cancer Classification with Neural Network 🌸



Welcome to the Breast Cancer Classification project! This elegant implementation leverages a neural network built with TensorFlow/Keras to classify breast tumors as Benign or Malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset. With a focus on simplicity and clarity, this project provides a robust pipeline for data processing, model training, and prediction, all wrapped in an intuitive predictive system.



✨ Project Overview

This project uses a feedforward neural network to predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant based on 30 features from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a predictive system for real-world applications. Visualizations of accuracy and loss provide insights into model performance, making it both educational and practical.

📊 Dataset

The project utilizes the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset from scikit-learn, featuring:





569 samples: 357 Benign (1) and 212 Malignant (0) cases.



30 features: Numerical attributes like mean radius, texture, and perimeter, derived from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA).



Target variable: Binary classification (0 = Malignant, 1 = Benign).



🛠 Features





Data Preprocessing: Standardizes features using StandardScaler for consistent scaling.



Neural Network: A sleek feedforward network with one hidden layer (20 units, ReLU) and an output layer (2 units, sigmoid).



Training: Trains for 10 epochs with a 10% validation split for robust learning.



Evaluation: Visualizes accuracy and loss curves and computes test accuracy.



Predictive System: Classifies new tumor data as Benign or Malignant with ease.



🚀 Installation

Get started in a few simple steps! Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed.





Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-classification.git
cd breast-cancer-classification



Install Dependencies: The project includes a requirements.txt file for seamless setup. Run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

The requirements.txt includes:

numpy>=1.19.0
pandas>=1.0.0
matplotlib>=3.3.0

🎯 Usage





Run the Script: Execute the main script to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate performance:

python breast_cancer_classification.py



What It Does:





Loads and preprocesses the dataset.



Trains the neural network for 10 epochs.



Generates plots for training/validation accuracy and loss.



Evaluates the model on the test set.



Demonstrates predictions using a sample input.



Make Predictions: To classify a new tumor, update the input_data variable in breast_cancer_classification.py with a 30-feature vector and run the script. The output will indicate whether the tumor is Benign or Malignant.



🧠 Model Architecture

The neural network is a clean, sequential model built with Keras:





Input Layer: Flatten layer to process the 30-dimensional input.



Hidden Layer: Dense layer with 20 units and ReLU activation for feature learning.



Output Layer: Dense layer with 2 units and sigmoid activation for binary classification.



Optimizer: Adam for efficient optimization.



Loss Function: Sparse categorical crossentropy for binary classification.



Metric: Accuracy to track performance.
